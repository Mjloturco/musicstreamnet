	abstract = {Following their success in Computer Vision and other areas, deep learning techniques have recently become widely adopted in Music Information Retrieval ({MIR}) research. However, the majority of works aim to adopt and assess methods that have been shown to be eﬀective in other domains, while there is still a great need for more original research focusing on music primarily and utilising musical knowledge and insight. The goal of this paper is to boost the interest of beginners by providing a comprehensive tutorial and reducing the barriers to entry into deep learning for {MIR}. We lay out the basic principles and review prominent works in this hard to navigate ﬁeld. We then outline the network structures that have been successful in {MIR} problems and facilitate the selection of building blocks for the problems at hand. Finally, guidelines for new tasks and some advanced topics in deep learning are discussed to stimulate new research in this fascinating ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {At present, accurately predicting fashion trends and predicting music black horses has become the key to attracting and catering to the masses. In view of the superiority of deep learning in data mining, data analysis and processing, this paper analyzes the music dataset, understands the distribution and characteristics of the data, and preprocesses the dataset. Aiming at the trend of the singer song playback volume in the data set within 6 months, the training set of the neural network is slid by combining the corresponding song play amount, play mean value and variance as the samples of the corresponding time points. Based on the above analysis and processing, this paper proposes a music popular trend prediction model based on {LSTM} deep learning, and designs and implements experiments for this model. The experimental results show that the {LSTM} deep learning based music trend prediction method used in this paper is more obvious than the traditional machine learning method ({SVM}, {BP} neural network, etc.) in the root mean square error ({RMSE}) index.},

Most streaming platforms provide tools to assess the popularity of a song by means of scores and rankings. In this paper, we present a methodology for predicting if a song will appear on Spotify’s Top 50 Global ranking after a certain amount of time. Spotify is one of the biggest streaming services and if a song is popular on this platform, it is likely to ensure good ﬁnancial return to the artists and their label. We approach the problem as a classiﬁcation task and employ classiﬁers built on past information from the platform’s Top 50 Global ranking, in addition to acoustic features from the songs. The Support Vector Machine classiﬁer with {RBF} kernel reached the best results in our experiments with an {AUC} higher than 80\% when predicting the popularity of songs two months in advance.},

	abstract = {The continuous evolution of multimedia applications is fostering applied research in order to dynamically enhance the services provided by platforms such as Spotify, Lastfm, or Billboard. Thus, innovative methods for retrieving speciﬁc information from large volumes of data related with music arises as a potential challenge within the Music Information Retrieval ({MIR}) framework. Moreover, despite the existence of several musical-based datasets, there is still a lack of information to properly assess an accurate estimation of the impact or the popularity of a song within a platform. Furthermore, the aforementioned platforms measure the popularity in various manners, thus increasing the difﬁculties in performing generalized and comparable models. In this paper, the creation of {SpotGenTrack} Popularity Dataset ({SPD}) is presented as an alternative solution to existing datasets that will facilitate researchers when comparing and promoting their models. In addition, an innovative multimodal end-to-end Deep Learning architecture named as {HitMusicNet} is presented for predicting popularity in music recordings. Experiments conducted show that the proposed architecture outperforms previous studies in the State-of-the-Art by incorporating three main modalities to the analysis, such as audio, lyrics and meta-data as well as a preliminary compression stage via autoencoder to better the capability of the model when predicting the popularity.},

	abstract = {The big data about music history contains information about time and users' behavior. Researchers could predict the trend of popular songs accurately by analyzing this data. The traditional trend prediction models can better predict the short trend than the long trend. In this paper, we proposed the improved {LSTM} Rolling Prediction Algorithm ({LSTM}-{RPA}), which combines {LSTM} historical input with current prediction results as model input for next time prediction. Meanwhile, this algorithm converts the long trend prediction task into multiple short trend prediction tasks. The evaluation results show that the {LSTM}-{RPA} model increased F score by 13.03\%, 16.74\%, 11.91\%, 18.52\%, compared with {LSTM}, {BiLSTM}, {GRU} and {RNN}. And our method outperforms tradi-tional sequence models, which are {ARIMA} and {SMA}, by 10.67\% and 3.43\% improvement in F score.Code: https://github.com/maliaosaide/lstm-rpa},

Deep Learning algorithms have shown to be very powerful in forecasting tasks, such as economic time series or speech recognition. Up to now, Deep Learning algorithms have only been applied sparsely for forecasting renewable energy power plants. By using different Deep Learning and Artificial Neural Network algorithms, such as Deep Belief Networks, {AutoEncoder}, and {LSTM}, we introduce these powerful algorithms in the field of renewable energy power forecasting. In our experiments, we used combinations of these algorithms to show their forecast strength compared to a standard {MLP} and a physical forecasting model in the forecasting the energy output of 21 solar power plants. Our results using Deep Learning algorithms show a superior forecasting performance compared to Artificial Neural Networks as well as other reference models such as physical models.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},
